Have you seen season 3 of Silicon Valley? The one where the plucky startup, Pied Piper, gets its first round of venture capital, and the VCs foist upon them a high-end director of sales, Jack Barker.

Jack Barker is played brilliantly by Stephen Tobolowsky (Ned! Ned Ryerson!), and he is instantly identifiable as a BS-MBA kind of personality with nothing in common with the scrappy tech-geek-makers who founded Pied Piper.

As his first act of leadership, standing in the conspicuously largest individual office in the building, he proudly presents the framed diagram of his award-winning business consultant quackery that will be the key to Pied Piper's future: The Conjoined Triangles of Success.

I love this joke.

# A Conjoined Triangles of My Very Own
One day, while I was just minding my design options, the Muse visited me with a vision of some quackery of my own: The Argyle Sweater of Product Excellence. 

Behold, the framework for all our Software as a Service product-problems!:

![argyle-sweater-of-product-excellence](argyle-sweater-of-product-excellence.png)

One diagram to rule them all.

I thought mine was worthy of a little chuckle as well.
Someday I'll actually commission the sweater and wear it proudly to conferences.

But also, it is not a joke at all!

To me, it's an elegant visualization of a framework for structuring team alignment in a **user-centered product-led organization**. It represents four phases of collaborative creativity in a SaaS startup. A little structure and process liberate the effectiveness of a team in pursuit of a vision.

Often business processes can come across pretty cheesy or wonky or totally disconnected from the work of making (like Jack Barker), so I thought a little self-deprecating humor might help people have a foothold into what I believe are actually some pretty outstanding ideas. This is a map to the place where ambitious visions are built into real.

But also, still a joke. Work should be fun.

# Methodology Mashup

The Argyle Sweater of Product Excellence is a convergence of three important ideas that were bouncing around the SaaS startup universe in the 2010s:

## I - Design Thinking's Double Diamond
In the mid 2010s, Design Thinking was a huge buzzword in business administration. Some MBA-types caught wind of [IDEO's brilliant communications about industrial design processes](https://designthinking.ideo.com/), and realized what commercial designers have known for many years: a human-centered design process of structured creative exploration yields superior results in business. 

Being a designer by training and practice, I am of course very biased towards this approach personally, and it's made for a fun and fruitful career. But I very sincerely do not believe one needs the word "designer" in their job title for these principles to be critically important. Within a collaborative creative enterprise, **every** contributor is a designer. We all must be mindful of how we navigate the design spaces we inevitably traverse in our thought-work. Design Thinking is for everyone; it is a team-sport.

>Good design goes to heaven; bad design goes everywhere.
>—Mieke Gerritzen


I feel the most fundamental principles of Design Thinking are these:

![1-venn-diagram-of-desirability-feasibility-viability](null.png)

![2-diverge-converge-diamond](null.png)

![3-problem-space-solution-space-double-diamond](null.png)

### 1 - Human-Centered Design: The End-User's Experience is King
A lot of opinions go into making a thing. But only one **opinion** truly matters to how a thing is designed: is it _**Desirable**_ to the end-user? Not the buyer. Not the strategist. The person who interacts with the thing and puts it to use. 

Not to say the stake-holders have nothing to add. They inform the design space with **constraints**. Is it _**Feasible**_ (can it be technologically be achieved)? Is it _**Viable**_ (can its value-exchange make money and generate cash)? 

### 2 - Diverge & Converge: Design Exploration Spaces are Diamond-shaped
Perhaps the fundamental skill of a designer, and probably all thought-workers, is creativity. Like most skills, creativity is not magic. It is a proficiency developed through mindful and talented practice. It has a process: **Diverge** the possibilities by generating many disparate ideas, then **Converge** on the options-combination that is most desirable. **Genesis**, then **Synthesis**. Creativity can be diagrammed as a diamond.

I call this diamond the **Design Space**. A place you can explore with terrain and hazards and rewards inside. The goal of design is to make the simplest, most efficient, most rewarding path through that space.

When diverging, the focus is on reaching out in as many fundamentally different directions as possible. You won't know where the rewards are in the space until you explore.

When converging, the focus should be on how well the design optimizes the space. What about this idea makes it better than others at navigating the design space's objectives and constraints? How can I combine ideas into a hybrid that navigates the space even better?


### 3 - The Double Diamond: Explore Problem Space before you Explore Solution Space
In User Experience design circles, Design Thinking is practiced as the Double Diamond. The work is split into two distinct phases. First, you navigate the **Problem Design Space** where you design the question: What do users need? Then you navigate the **Solution Design Space** where you design the answer: This cures user need. Segregating the spaces helps fight the powerful temptation to discuss solutions before you fully understand the problem.

In the Problem Design Space, the primary activity is research. You diverge by empathizing as many hypotheses about what users need as you can, reaching out in all directions. Then you converge by testing those hypotheses by asking users directly in interviews or by observing their behavior. The outcome is a user-validated **Problem Statement** (not just a guess).

In the Solution Design Space, the primary activity is prototyping. You diverge by building broadly different toy **Solutions** to solve the validated user Problem. You converge by testing those prototypes on users to see how well each approach solves their problem. You slam the best candidates together in later iterations, testing again to prove what solves best. The outcome is a prototype design based on user feedback: Yes, that approach will solve my problem in a way I like.

Armed with these tools, anybody can think like a designer! May the world be so blessed that we all do. I hope every reader takes that seriously: be the designer your work calls you to be. The Argyle Sweater can help you get started.

## II - Lean Startup's Build, Measure, Learn
It's impossible to have worked in a tech startup in the last ten years without at least obliquely hearing about Eric Ries's approach to the Lean methodology. **Lean** is a shorthand to refer to principles of business practice developed at Toyota and popularized worldwide since the mid-1980s. At its core is a value for eliminating waste at every level of a business's operation. As a denizen of Silicon Valley, Eric Ries postulated that if startups had a no-waste way of practicing innovation, more of them would be successful and innovation will happen faster. Lean Startup is the methodology that emerged from his research.

If you are not familiar with Lean Startup, I am still confident you are familiar with its buzzwords. Hyped or not, I find three principles from Lean Startup to be very insightful and powerful in practice.

![pmf-homing-curve](null.png)
![mvp-value-delivery-curve](null.png)
![build-measure-learn-triquetra](null.png)

### 1 - Validated Learning
The end goal of all Lean Startup activities is to learn, specifically to learn what the market needs and is willing to pay for. What problem is _really_ out there? The faster you learn that, the more efficient the startup is at delivering that innovation to the marketplace and capturing the perceived value of the solution.

So we look at running a SaaS startup as a series of designed experiments that help us learn and home in on product-market-fit, and therefore revenue. 

### 2 - Minimum Viable Product
Each iteration should be a whole solution from which you can learn. Make the cupcake, then the sheet-cake, then the layer cake, then the wedding cake. Each iteration adds complexity, but more importantly, in between each iteration you have tastings and feedback on the fundamental value perception.

The notion is to build the minimum prototype you need to learn something from the marketplace, use it in a designed experiment, then use the learnings to inform the next iteration. Sometimes these experiments are internal conceptual design iterations (cupcakes and layer cakes), sometimes (sheet cakes and wedding cakes) you run the tests directly in the marketplace with real product and real customers.

Among designers and product managers, the phrase Minimum Viable Product is increasingly verboten, on account of its rampant misuse as an output-focused excuse to cut corners. The principle of "the minimum amount of effort to learn" is still extremely prescient. That's the baby we keep as we throw out the MVP bathwater. Let's call it "Solution Exploration" instead, though. 

>Experiment to learn, build to earn. —Melissa Perri

### 3 - Continuous Improvement
Whether it's Ries's new-fangled application or the classic practices of the Toyota Production System, Lean business practice hinges on one essential principle: [_Kaizen_, or Continuous Improvement](https://www.kaizen.com/what-is-kaizen.html). 

A Lean organization must continuously evaluate itself and strive to get better. Everyone, everywhere, every day: create customer value, eliminate waste, follow the action, empower people, keep score.

In the Eric Ries version of continuous improvement, we have a simpler spiral: Build, Measure, Learn. 


## III - The Golden Circle: Why, What, and How

Of course, nobody can explain the Golden Circle and the power of Start With Why quite like Simon Sinek. So if you have five minutes, hear him out in this abridged cut of his famous (and maybe a little dated) TED talk:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IPYeCltXpxw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The gist: the logical part of our brains gets to respond last after our intuitive brain controls decision making. So if we want messages (such as, "hey team, this is the mission we need to accomplish") to resonate and drive behavior, we should appeal to the intuitive part of the brain. The WHY is what resonates there.
 
![golden-circle-bullseye](null.png)
![three-beads-on-a-sting](null.png)
![beads-on-a-string-over-argyle](null.png)

### 1 - Start with WHY
To obtain team alignment, we must constantly appeal to what I call the **Steel Thread**. It's the always-visible, never-breakable connection between what we are doing and why we are doing it. As we do our work, the Steel Thread helps us trace our way through the labyrinth. No matter the WHAT or HOW, our team should always be able to trace what we are doing clearly back to WHY.

There are several WHY artifacts available at different levels of specificity: Vision, Mission, Business Goals, Business Objectives, Customer Objectives, User Objectives. They all speak to the desired outcomes. And Outcomes are what this is all about.

### 2 - HOW Is the Fun Part
I have learned from unfortunate experience that development teams crave to be designers too. For a time as a first-time product manager I designed all the solutions to meet project requirements up front and then took detailed specifications to the software engineers to build. This didn't work. Every time I took this documentation-heavy approach, I found engineers would skim (no so much read) my specifications, intuit (but not so much ask) the underlying WHY, then design some novel solution that neither matched the specification nor its underlying requirements.

This failed because I took away the fun part. 

Deciding HOW to build the WHAT, solving the puzzle, is what makers enjoy the most.
And it should be! They have deep knowledge of implementation constraints and opportunities which are impossible to fully comprehend earlier in the design process.

The worst thing in a maker's work is when someone just hands down (wrong) instructions-to-follow that don't consider all the realities in the trenches. Makers are experts, not order-takers. The purpose of starting with WHY is to inspire. Nobody finds inspiration in following directions.

### 3 - Be Great at All Three
Defining and communicating a great WHY is not enough. The key is to be great at all three. We can do that by connecting the beads of HOW and WHAT to WHY with the steel thread of connection at all times. Perhaps the most valuable contribution a thought worker make is to generate clarity of thought by always referring the detail of WHAT we are doing back through the steel thread to WHY we are doing it. Explain it to yourself. Depict it clearly to others. It manages up; it manages sideways; it surrounds us, it penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.

--

When we slam all these big ideas together (Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and The Golden Circle) we find they are very compatible. We find they combine to form an argyle sweater (of excellence!).

![argyle-sweater-of-product-excellence](argyle-sweater-of-product-excellence.png)

We have Quadruple Diamonds: **Strategy** Design Space, **Problem** Design Space, **Solution** Design Space, and **Development** Design Space, each diverging and converging to inform the next.

We have iterative cycles of **Build**, **Measure**, **Learn** within the prototyping of the Solution Design Space and the continuous improvement of the Development Design Space.

We have the pearls of The Golden Circle, connecting **What** and **How** back to **Why** at all times through the steel thread.

Taken together, we have a very clear map of the worlds we will explore, and how our teams will work together as we do so.

# The Teams
Product excellence is a creative collaboration of different specialties pulling in the same direction. Alignment and communication are essential. The Argyle Sweater recommends some structure to harmonize the team.

These teams have a consecutive process like a relay race. We ought not think their teamwork is in any way hierarchical. Those who hold the baton at any moment are not doing the bidding of those who held it before. We are _ALL_ designers. We are all collaborating as peers to discover and describe the proverbial elephant.

## Business Leadership Team
Business strategists own the **Viability** dimension of design thinking. Can it be economically sustained?

This team explores the Strategy design space: What value-perceptions exist in the marketplace that align with our mission and are valuable enough for customers to pay more for a problem-solution than it costs for us to create the solution? How can our business structure our approach to these problems so we have enough cash flow to stay alive long enough to bring these solutions to market and capture that exchange of value? How can we sustain those solutions and cash flows over time?

This team focuses on expressing Vision and Mission in executable Strategy and Goals. Business Leadership owns the **WHY**.

## Product Research Teams
Product strategists own the **Desirability** dimension of design thinking. Is it extremely valuable and well-fit to the end-user?

This team is an amalgam of two sub-teams. To use a sports analogy, I see the Product Research Team to be like ice hockey or basketball. There are two sets of specialists in the game at the same time: three forwards (one called center), and two defenders. The whole team has a modality: offense or defense. In each modality, the positions take more commanding or supportive roles, and they have a specific part of the field to own. There is no point siloing the sub-teams. They must work closely together in each modality for anything to work at all. But they have clear and separate roles, leveraging their unique abilities and expertise.

A Product Research team is made up of Product Managers and Product Designers. Product Managers take the lead in the Problem design space, while Product Designers take the lead in the Solution design space.Product Managers have greater skills in problem discovery and business analysis, including competitive analysis, market analysis, and customer interviews. They advocate first for the _business benefit_ in users' pains, gains, and jobs to do. Product Designers have greater skills in solution ideation and user experience analysis, such as information architecture, interface design, prototyping, and testing. They advocate first for the _user benefit_ in the cures and wins of the product to hire_. 

This team together explores the Problem design and Solution design spaces. Their different orientations help create an adversarial collaboration to balance business objectives and user objectives while exploring the design spaces. Sometimes a great play in Problem design sets up a breakaway and a slam-dunk Solution design.

This team is all about learning the realities of the design space through Research and generating an agile product Specification that will achieve the business Goals. Product Research owns refining the **WHY**, then defining the **WHAT**.

## Product Development Teams
Product makers own the **Feasibility** dimension of design thinking. Can it be technologically achieved?

Makers are found in all the various front-line roles that create the many components of a SaaS software product. Multiple teams of makers will be involved, each with specialized knowledge and skills. These teams explore the Development design space: What is the most efficient and maintainable implementation of the Specification? 

Product Development Teams own the **HOW**. They have free rein over many important decisions that turn a mere idea into a reality. Implementation design decisions should not alter the desirability of the user-centric Specification, but ought to make enormous impact on the feasibility and viability of the product.

# The Diamonds
The four diamonds of the Argyle Sweater are the legs of the relay race on the way to highly-aligned evidence-based product fit with lean implementation. Four phases of Genesis and Synthesis.

Each diamond begins by Diverging, generating options to consider. Cultivate a practice for doing the challenging work of individual brainstorming beyond the obvious. Arm yourself with tools for generating **many** substantively different ideas. Be ready to reach out in forbidden directions; what is not viable on its own, may be excellent in combination.

Each diamond ends by Converging, weighing options against the design landscape and each other to select which best strikes the balance between user-desirability, technical-feasibility, and business-viability. Synthesizing two or more options that don't quite solve may lead to something that balances better. Interrogating one idea will likely lead to another, better one. Multiple minds can be particularly good at slamming options together into better solutions, so take your individual brainstorms to a collaborator to help decide how to converge.

Let's step through the sections of the Argyle Sweater to recap.

## 1 - Define the Strategy - Strategy Design Space
First, the business leadership team defines the **WHY** at the heart of what the organization is going to create. What valuable change in the world are we building? What opportunities exist in the marketplace as we pursue that vision and mission? How will these opportunities keep the business alive by making money and generating cash? 

|     | Strategy Design Space    |
| --- | --- |
| **Who** | Business Leadership owns this design space. |
| **Why** | Define the WHY by connecting the Vision and Mission to profits and cash flows. |
| **Diverge** | Ideate on:<br/> - positioning in the marketplace<br/> - business models with competitive advantage<br/> - competitive advantage in contested value propositions |
| **Converge** | Validate:<br/> - market opportunities align with vision and mission  <br/> - market opportunities for revenues are large and likely <br/>  - operational opportunities for profit margin are large and likely <br/> - business model is highly defensible |
| **Inputs** | Vision<br/> Mission <br/> Market and Competitive Research |
| **Outputs** | Market Opportunity Options<br/> Business Goals (outcomes, profits, cash flows) |

## 2 - Understand the Problem - Problem Design Space
Second, the Product Research teams seek to disprove the hypotheses of the Market Opportunity Options through user research, led by Product Managers. Options that survive the testing become Validated Problems. The teams quantify how much of the business Goals will plausibly be achieved by each Problem, and prioritize them accordingly for solution design and development. This evidence-based qualification of strategic ideas finalizes the **WHY** we are going to develop the _next_ thing.

|     | Problem Design Space    |
| --- | --- |
| **Who** | Product Research Teams own this design space, with Product Managers playing the primary role. |
| **Why** | Define the WHY by connecting Vision, Mission, Business Goals to real user Problems.  |
| **Diverge** | Ideate on:<br/> - ways to directly observe user problems <br/> - ways to get users to describe their problems <br/> - ways for users to quantify the value of their problems |
| **Converge** | Validate:<br/> - pains, gains, jobs to do (jobs to hire)<br/> - relative value of pains, gains, jobs <br/> - overlap of Market Opportunity Options with empirical Problems |
| **Inputs** | Market Opportunity Options<br/> Business Goals (outcomes, profits, cash flows) |
| **Outputs** | Validated Problem with:<br/> - Goal-aligned Business Objectives <br/> - Evidence-based User Objectives <br/> - Constraints (technical, time/cost, regulatory, ethical, security, etc.) |

## 3 - Experiment for Solution Fit - Solution Design Space
Third, the Product Research teams put all the cards down on the table to reveal the solution design landscape: Validated Problem, Objectives, and Constraints. The Product Designers take the lead in generating many options for each design question in the Solution Design Space. Through iterations of hypothesis-driven prototype testing, they home in on the most desirable product design for real users. Based on that empirical data, they craft a highly-fit solution Specification that clearly outlines **WHAT** to build.

A side note: Without a formal process, there's a gravity that pulls us to begin here in this phase, which I call "premature solutioning". That instinct is wrong. It leads to the build trap. Resist the temptation to prescribe before you diagnose.

|     | Solution Design Space    |
| --- | --- |
| **Who** | Product Research Teams own this design space, with Product Designers playing the primary role. |
| **What** | Define the WHAT by designing desirable, feasible, viable Solutions to validated user Problems.  |
| **Diverge** | Ideate on:<br/> - divergent ways to approach the problem<br/> - divergent design options within a validated approach |
| **Converge** | Validate:<br/> - user finds the proposed Solution desirable - it solves their Problems<br/> - development teams find the solution feasible - it can be built <br/> - business leadership finds the solution viable - it will make money and generate cash |
| **Iterate** | External iterations of learning-oriented prototype experiments <br/> Internal iterations of design decision trees and diagrams for fine details |
| **Inputs** | Validated Problem, Business Objectives, User Objectives, Constraints |
| **Outputs** | Product Specification: A WHAT-oriented Solution design that includes potential phases and escape hatches for agile development <br/> Prototypes, diagrams, and mockups to guide development  |

## 4 - Create the Outcome - Development Design Space
Last, Development teams take the highly qualified Solution Specification an its Prototypes and translates it into a real product. Once again, all the cards are laid on the table: Specification, Business Objectives, User Objectives, Constraints. With autonomy and accountability for budget, timing, quality, maintainability, and technical debts, they explore implementation options, determining **HOW** to build the product. Lean and Agile principles come strongly into play as they minimize waste, horse-trade, and escape-hatch a way to realize business Goals by delivering a complete, delightful product. By iterating through planned phases of whole-product value delivery, they optimize the solution over time from cupcake to layer-cake to wedding-cake.

|     | Development Design Space    |
| --- | --- |
| **Who** | Development Teams wholly own this design space. Nobody else can tell them HOW! |
| **How** | Define the HOW by making design decisions that meet the user Specification and realize the business Goals while optimizing budget, timing, and quality. |
| **Diverge** | Ideate on: <br/> - options to navigate technical and other constraints <br/> - options for reducing scope <br/> - options for phasing scope to deliver value in iterations |
| **Converge** | Validate: <br/> - the implementation is feasible - it can be built and maintained <br/> - the implementation is viable - it will deliver enough value on time |
| **Iterate** | Implement planned phases of value delivery to optimize the user-value and user-fit curves as fast as possible |
| **Inputs** | Product Specification, Business Objectives, User Objectives, Constraints  |
| **Outputs** | Products / Features delivered to the marketplace |

# Excellence Is a Habit
To close out, I would like to encourage the reader to give this process a try at least twice. If it doesn't crash and burn (it will not), try to make it a habit. Once the steel thread and the four diamond process are a habit at every level, then the structure of the organization will be highly aligned, user-centric, evidence-based, and lean. It will not be enough, though, to practice this design thinking process only in one or two of the three teams. All must practice design equally in their respective leg of the relay, or alignment is impossible.

Delegate the four diamonds to their respective teams. Focus on nailing those input/output handoffs. Make the WHY and WHAT as clear as day, always referring back to them through the Steel Thread at every unit of work, at every point of documentation, in every single meeting. Explain the learnings of Problem Exploration and Solution Exploration iterations at every handoff. Follow the evidence, advocate for the user, mind the Objectives and Constraints.

Every goal the Leadership Team sets should speak to the Vision and Mission and define the Outcome we are after.
Every requirement the Product Management Teams declare should align to both the business Goals, and the user Needs.
Every Specification the Product Management Teams craft should point to business- and user-Objectives, Constraints, and the experimental learnings from prior iterations.
Every pull request the Development Teams make should speak to WHY, WHAT, and HOW.

I leave you with the greatest wisdom known to the great designers who have gone before us:
>Art lives from constraints and dies from freedom. —Leonardo da Vinci

Structure and process make creative collaboration flow smoother, faster, more consistently. It only takes a little bit, applied consistently, to make a huge difference.
Excellence is a habit.
